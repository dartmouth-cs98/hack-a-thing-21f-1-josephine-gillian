# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

A minimalist version of Pokemon GO!, with a Map scene where a number of Pokemons spawn randomly at fixed time intervals, and a Catch scene with ball throwing and curved throwing mechanisms to catch the Pokemon. The game also keeps track of how many Pokemons the user has caught.

## Who Did What?

We followed the tutorial series together in the same room, but Gillian handled the coding for the first half of the tutorial (videos 1-5), and Josephine handled the remaining videos.

## What you learned

The MapBox API as done in the video tutorials did not work for us because it is deprecated. We tried to use the updated MapBox SDK, but we decided that the focus of the tutorial is the game rather than the map. So, we used a static map .PNG of Dartmouth's campus and spawned Pokemons on it.
